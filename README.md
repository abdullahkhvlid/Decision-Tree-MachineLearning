# Decision-Tree-MachineLearning


This project builds a **Decision Tree Classifier** on the Kaggle Titanic dataset to demonstrate model training, preprocessing, and interpretability.

## Project Overview

* Imported and prepared the dataset
* Applied feature encoding using LabelEncoder
* Trained a Decision Tree model for survival prediction
* Visualized the Decision Tree diagram using Matplotlib
* Showcased the end-to-end pipeline of supervised learning

## Why Decision Trees

Decision Trees are powerful classification models that provide high interpretability. They clearly illustrate how input features contribute to predictions, making them ideal for learning and explaining machine learning concepts.

## Key Steps

1. Dataset preprocessing and encoding with LabelEncoder
2. Feature engineering for categorical variables
3. Model training using DecisionTreeClassifier
4. Accuracy evaluation on survival prediction
5. Visualization of the decision tree with Matplotlib

## Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib

Do you want me to also create a **standardized format** for both projects (same structure, same flow), so they look consistent when someone visits your GitHub?
